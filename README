This module provides an interface to SmugMug image galleries.

All functionality provided by the SmugMug API is represented by this 
module. Also available is a wrapper around the smugmug search 
functionality for searching for images that contain particular keywords.

The search functionality requires Public.Web.RSS, and will return empty 
result sets if this module is not installed.

Also, note that a SmugMug API key is required to use this module (except 
for the search functionality, which works independently of the rest of the 
module's functions.
